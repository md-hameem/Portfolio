## How It All Started

My passion for technology began early on, and it led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Zhengzhou University. Since then, I've been continuously expanding my skill set, diving deep into programming languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++. My interest in Machine Learning and Deep Learning grew as I explored their potential in solving real-world problems.

## The First Steps

My initial foray into web development involved learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I became more comfortable with these technologies, I started experimenting with frameworks like React and Next.js. Building web applications provided a practical way to apply my knowledge and see the immediate impact of my work.

### Interning at Luday AB

During my internship at Luday AB, I gained valuable hands-on experience in developing SAAS projects using React, Next.js, and Python Flask. I led the creation of platforms like a social media management tool and a family networking app. This role helped me refine my problem-solving skills and highlighted the importance of teamwork and collaboration.

## Transitioning to Full Stack Development

My experience at Flamingo Footwear Limited further solidified my skills as a Full Stack Web Developer. I focused on optimizing performance and ensuring seamless user experiences for global trade platforms. This role involved handling both front-end and back-end tasks, designing data models, implementing security measures, and integrating payment gateways for e-commerce sites.

## Continuous Learning and Growth

My commitment to learning is reflected in my pursuit of certifications and advanced courses. I have completed courses in advanced JavaScript, data analytics, and supervised machine learning from renowned institutions like Tuition Bear, Google INC., and Deeplearning.ai. These certifications have helped me stay updated with the latest advancements in the field.

## Challenges and Solutions

While my journey has been rewarding, it hasn't been without challenges. Integrating new technologies and ensuring compatibility with existing systems often required creative problem-solving. For example, during my internship at Luday AB, I had to resolve critical bugs left by previous developers, achieving a 95% bug-fix success rate.

## Looking Ahead

I am excited about the future and the opportunities it holds. My goal is to continue exploring the intersection of web development and machine learning, creating innovative solutions that make a difference. I look forward to collaborating with like-minded professionals and contributing to the ever-evolving field of software engineering.

## Update: May 2024

Recently, I've been exploring new frameworks and tools to enhance my development workflow. I've started using Remix for its excellent support for CSS modules and smooth route transitions. This has significantly improved the efficiency and aesthetics of my projects. I am also looking into the upcoming scroll-driven animations CSS API to replace JavaScript-triggered animations for a more seamless user experience.

Overall, my journey in software engineering has been a blend of learning, experimenting, and growing. I am excited to continue this journey, embracing new challenges and opportunities along the way.
