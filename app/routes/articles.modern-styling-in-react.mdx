When I first tried CSS-in-JS libraries like [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh), the thing that felt right about it was passing values or state directly into the styles for a component. It really closed the loop with the concept of React where the UI is a function of state. While this was a definite advancement over the traditional way of styling React with classes and pre-processed CSS, it still had its problems.

To highlight some examples, I'll break down some typical scenarios using two main types of dynamic styles you'll encounter with React components:

1. **Values:** These are individual CSS property values like color, delay, or position.
2. **States:** These are more complex styles representing component states, such as primary button variants or loading states.

## Where we are today

For comparison, I'll use SCSS (with [BEM syntax](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/)) and Styled Components to demonstrate typical approaches to styling React components. I won't cover CSS-in-JS libraries that write CSS as JavaScript objects; if you prefer that method, I'd recommend [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/). My focus here is for those who enjoy writing CSS as CSS, but want to integrate it smoothly with React's dynamic nature.

If you're already familiar with the problem, [skip to the solution](#theres-a-better-way-vanilla-css).

### Values

Using vanilla CSS or pre-processed CSS like LESS or SCSS, the traditional method for dynamic styling was inline styles. For example, a button component with a dynamic color might look like this:

```jsx
function Button({ color, children }) {
  return (
    <button className="button" style={{ backgroundColor: color }}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

The problem with this approach is the increased specificity and separation from the rest of our styles.

CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled Components or Emotion improved this by allowing dynamic values directly as props:

```jsx
function Button({ color, children }) {
  return <StyledButton color={color}>{children}</StyledButton>;
}

const StyledButton = styled.button`
  border: 0;
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 8px 12px;
  font-size: 14px;
  color: dimgrey;
  background-color: ${props => props.color};
`;
```

### States

Traditionally, we'd use CSS classes and concatenate strings, often resulting in messy code. For example:

```jsx
function Button({ color, size, primary, children }) {
  return (
    <button
      className={['button', `button--${size}`, primary ? 'button--primary' : null]
        .filter(Boolean)
        .join(' ')}
      style={{ backgroundColor: color }}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

```scss
.button {
  border: 0;
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 8px 12px;
  font-size: 14px;
  color: dimgrey;
  background-color: whitesmoke;

  &--primary {
    background-color: $primary-color;
  }

  &--small {
    height: 30px;
  }

  &--medium {
    height: 40px;
  }

  &--large {
    height: 60px;
  }
}
```

The SCSS looks clean, but the JSX string concatenation is cumbersome. Styled Components handle this slightly better, but it can still be verbose:

```jsx
function Button({ color, size, primary, children }) {
  return (
    <StyledButton color={color} primary={primary} size={size}>{children}</StyledButton>
  );
}

const StyledButton = styled.button`
  border: 0;
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 8px 12px;
  font-size: 14px;
  color: dimgrey;
  background-color: whitesmoke;

  ${props => props.primary && css`
    background-color: $primary-color;
  `}

  ${props => props.size === 'small' && css`
    height: 30px;
  `}

  ${props => props.size === 'medium' && css`
    height: 40px;
  `}

  ${props => props.size === 'large' && css`
    height: 60px;
  `}
`;
```

It gets even messier with multiple conditions:

```jsx
const StyledButton = styled.button`
  border: 0;
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 8px 12px;
  font-size: 14px;
  color: dimgrey;

  ${props =>
    props.primary
      ? css`
          height: 60px;
          background-color: darkslateblue;
        `
      : css`
          height: 40px;
          background-color: whitesmoke;
        `}
`;
```

## There's a better way: vanilla CSS

The solution has been with us all along: CSS custom properties (AKA CSS variables). These were less supported in the past but now enjoy wide browser support.

After experimenting with SCSS and Styled Components, I've returned to vanilla CSS. With frameworks adhering closer to web standards, like Remix and Deno, native CSS features are often more than sufficient. Here's how I approach styling React components with vanilla CSS, supplemented with postcss for features like nesting and custom media queries.

### Values

A neat trick is using CSS custom properties for dynamic values:

```jsx
function Button({ color, children }) {
  return (
    <button className="button" style={{ '--color': color }}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

```css
.button {
  border: 0;
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 8px 12px;
  font-size: 14px;
  color: dimgrey;
  background-color: var(--color);
}
```

This approach avoids the specificity issues of inline styles and keeps styles co-located.

### States

For component states and variants, I use data attributes. This works well with the upcoming native CSS nesting syntax:

```jsx
function Button({ color, size, primary, children }) {
  return (
    <button className="button" data-size={size} data-primary={primary}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

```css
.button {
  border: 0;
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 8px 12px;
  font-size: 14px;
  color: dimgrey;
  background-color: whitesmoke;

  &[data-primary='true'] {
    background-color: var(--colorPrimary);
  }

  &[data-size='small'] {
    height: 30px;
  }

  &[data-size='medium'] {
    height: 40px;
  }

  &[data-size='large'] {
    height: 60px;
  }
}
```

This method offers clean, structured styling and avoids the mess of string concatenation in class names.

While it might seem unconventional to use data attributes for styling, it aligns well with modern CSS practices and accessibility considerations.

Embracing these modern CSS features, we can create clean, maintainable, and dynamic styles without the overhead of CSS-in-JS libraries.
